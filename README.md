    Brief
</b>
<br />
A RESTful API for a simple contact form service.
<br />
It is to receive contact details (name, email and message) and persist the data.
<br />
Confirmation of a successful submission to be sent to the email supplied.
<br />
There should also be an endpoint to view all messages and individual messages.
<br />
No authentication is required, nor end client to consume endpoints.

    Things to consider
</b>
<br />
Although this is only a very simple task, please approach it as you would if it were a small
part of a medium-large website.
<br />
You should make your code easy to test and maintain.
<br />
You may also want to write some simple tests.
